# GrayBot

Now-defunct Discord bot I made for a personal server. Had some convenient features like an automatic spotify playlist, updating daily by pulling links from a specified channel and making a playlist from those songs.

Also featuring a command that writes fanfiction using Markov chains, kind of a fun one to use.

Everything in this project is modularized, each module inherits from Module.java and each command inherits from Command.java. One of my more elegant projects, worked out very well and it's very easy to debug.
