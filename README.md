# GrayBot

Now-defunct Discord bot I made for a personal server. Had some convenient features like an automatic spotify playlist, updating daily by pulling links from a specified channel and making a playlist from those songs.

Also featuring a command that writes fanfiction using Markov chains, kind of a fun one to use.
